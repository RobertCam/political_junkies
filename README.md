Poli Pocket is an app designed to return financing data on Presidential candidates by leveraging data from the opensecrets.org api.

When navigating to a certain candidates page the user will receive the following information regarding that candidates campaign:
      - Total donations received for the entire campaign from all donors
      - Total amount spent on the campaign so far
      - Amount of funds donated by the top 10 contributors, broken down into categories: Organizations, Industries, and Sectors.
      - Graphs for a visual representation the amounts donated within each category, further broken down into donations received through PAC contributions and individual contributions. 

Users also have the ability to compare candidates based on these same categories.

Use of the Google web search api is used to generate links to current related news articles on the home page.
